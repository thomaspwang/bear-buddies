If you haven't created an virtual environment in the bear-buddies/backend folder, navigate to the bear-buddies/backend folder and type:

```bash
python -m venv venv #if your keyword is python
```

or 

```bash
python3 -m venv venv #if your keyword is python3
```

To activate the Python virtual environment in the bear-buddies/backend folder, navigate to the bear-buddies/backend folder and type:

```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

You should see a (venv) to the left of your terminal.
